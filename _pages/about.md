Hi! I am Jiaqian, a junior student in the Deparmtent of Compuater Science, at Columbia University. I am from a joint bachelor degree program with City University of Hong Kong.

My intrests lie in computational complexity and game theory. I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Minming Li](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~minmli/).

You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/CV_Jiaqian.pdf).
